Flying


And I'm coming home
London in the rain
Driving real slow in the fast lane
Feelin' kinda stressed
Tryin' to get drunk
Problem with the rich kids is that they're no fun

Right now I'm flying
So come and take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It's sad how sad this life can be

Driving through the clouds
Picking all the bad
